# Code from mentoring sessions

This repository contains code that was generated by [Omar Trejo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/otrenav) during mentoring sessions. Some people might find some useful tips reading through this code.

Note: this repository was started recently, therefore you will not find too many examples for now. Hopefully I'll be filling this with lots of interesting examples.

As always, have fun learning something new!
