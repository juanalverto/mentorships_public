# Mentoring sessions

This repository contains code that was generated by [Omar Trejo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/otrenav) during mentoring sessions with other people through [CodeMentor](http://codementor.io/) or [HackHands](https://hackhands.com/). These are two highly recommended sites for people who want to be mentored, want to hire someone, or just want to learn something new.

Note: this repository was started recently, therefore you will not find too many examples for now. Hopefully I'll be filling this with lots of interesting examples.

As always, have fun learning something new!
